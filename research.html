                <h5>What Elements Make Up Music?</h5>
                <h6>Music is comprised of a few different elements, such as:

                    <li>Melody: a sweet or agreeable succession or arrangement of sounds</li>
                    <li>Harmony: the combination of simultaneously sounded musical notes to produce chords and chord progressions having a pleasing effect
                    <li>Timbre: perceived sound quality of a musical note, sound, or tone</li>
                    <li>Tone: steady periodic sound characterized by its duration, pitch, intensity, and timbre</li>
                    texture</li>
                    <li>Dynamics: variation in loudness between notes or phrases</li>

                <h6>
                    According to Berkely, music can make us feel these 13 emotions:

                <h5>Why Do We Listen to Music?</h5>
                <h6>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that affects how the body feels pleasure, is released when we listen to music. This can cause chills, which often happens when we feel moved by a song or piece of music. </li>
                    <li>Oxytocin, the “bonding” chemical, is released when you’re with another person, but also when you listen to music; it’s the warm, fuzzy feeling you get . This can be triggered by songs you particularly connect with, almost as if you’re forming a companionship with the music. </li>
                    <li>Listening to music in the company of others amplifies the emotional feeling of music </li>
                    <li>We can use music to emphasize how we’re already feeling, whether it be sad or happy. "Unhappy” music is still beneficial, as it can be a good way to express how we’re feeling and communicate our ideas.

                    </li> 
                    </ul>

                    How is Individual Music Taste Shaped?
                </h5>
                <h6>
                    A lot of it is shaped by what we grow up listening to. Our brains love familiarity, which is why the predictable structure of a pop song is so appealing. It also explains why experimental rap and jazz music are often acquired tastes, as the rhythm and cadence is oftentimes unpredictable and unfamiliar. However, with repetition comes desensitization; for example, the hundredth time you listen to your favorite song will never be as good as the first because you’re already used to it.
