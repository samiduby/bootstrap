                    <h6 class="polHead">My product of learning was making a playlist with one song for each emotion that music can make you feel. They're catered to my music taste, but I feel like they're universally enjoyable</h6>
                    <h6 class="emotion">
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amusement: Love You For A Long Time by Maggie Rogers</strong> - The song is upbeat and talking about love in a happy way. 
                    <li><strong>Joy: Dancing Queen by ABBA </strong>- This song is a classic. Everyone the words to this fun and upbeat song, and the trill of the piano at the beginning is iconic. </li>
                    <li><strong>Eroticism: Lovers Rock by TV Girl</strong> - The instrumental of the song is intimate and warm, and while the lyrics aren’t about people in love, they’re about people who have a connection with each other, as momentary as it may be. </li>
                    <li><strong>Beauty: The Gold (Phoebe Bridgers version) by Manchester Orchestra </strong>- This cover sounds so pretty. When I hear the guitar and piano, I see imagery of a field of wildgrasses. While the lyrics themselves are quite sad, talking about how a family struggles, the melancholy itself is beautiful. </li>
                    <li><strong>Relaxation: Dreams by Fleetwood Mac </strong>- The instrumental track to this song is mostly a drum beat and strong bass riff with some guitar. The lyrics, complimented well by Stevie Nicks’ soft voice, reference nature and how the metaphorical rain will clear your mind eventually. The song itself is rather mellow and relaxing, but the lyrics are also comforting. </li>
                    <li><strong>Sadness: She Lays Down by the 1975</strong> - The song is purely acousitc guitar and vocals, giving it a raw and hollow vibe. You can hear the authenticity in the singer’s voice as he sings about his mother’s postpartum depression. The lyrics are quite dark and depressing, but so genuine that it elicits an emotional response in me everytime. </li>
                    <li><strong>Dreaminess: Malibu 1992 by COIN </strong>- This song uses reverby and, for lack of better word, long sounds to emulate the feeling of a memory. The lyrics are reminiscing a specific moment in life, and the percussion’s sound is almost muted, making it feel nostalgic. </li>
                    <li><strong>Triumph: Good Days by SZA </strong>- This song also feels nostalgic, and the guitar getting louder at the beginning feels like gaining confidence. SZA always sings with confidence, and the subject matter in the song talks about how she’s moving on well after something happened. </li>
                    <li><strong>Anxiety: 505 by Arctic Monkeys</strong> - The song is about missing an old lover and trying to relive a moment in time, only to never be able to fully recreate it. There's a lot of tension and build up until the bridge of the song, slowly, the guitar riffs get faster and the song picks up tempo, making the listener anxious. </li>
                    <li><strong>Scariness: thirteen by C418 </strong>- There are no lyrics to this song, and it sounds rather eerie. Rather than having a melody, the song is kind of a jumble of noises and creaks. </li>
                    <li><strong>Annoyance: Spinning by No Rome, Charli XCX, the 1975</strong> - This song is upbeat, but quite repetitive and not for everyone. Personally, I like this song, but the lyrics aren’t very complex and it just sounds annoying. The singer's voice is high pitched, and the lyrics aren’t very comprehensible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defiance: Teenagers by My Chemical Romance</strong>- This song is about the standard teenage angst. The lyrics describe how ruthless and rebelious teenagers can be, and the choice of instruments, electric guitars in particular, emphasize the point. </li>
                    <li><strong>Pumped up: She Knows This by Kid Cudi </strong>- When the beat of the song comes in, the combination of Kid Cudi’s voice and the lyrics he’s speaking just pumps me up. He’s rapping about being at a party and feeling on top of the world. Before some of the “choruses”, the tempo speeds up quite a bit, which really emphasizes the energy of the song. </li>
                    </ul>
