                    <h6 class="emotion">
                    Amusement -  Love You For A Long Time by Maggie Rogers - The song is upbeat and talking about love in a happy way. 
                    Joy - Dancing Queen by ABBA - a classic. Everyone knows dancing queen to be a fun and upbeat song, and the trill of the piano at the beginning is iconic. Everyone knows the words, so its a social song. You can connect with people over it. The song itself talks about how special a young girl should feel. 
                    Eroticism - Lovers Rock by TV Girl - immediately the vibes of the song feel intimate and warm, and while the lyrics aren’t about people in love, they’re about people who have a connection with each other, as momentary as it may be. The constant beat stopping when the “couple” is talking, makes the song feel much more intimate. 
                    Beauty - The Gold (Phoebe Bridgers version) by Manchester Orchestra - this song is beautiful in my opinion because it just sounds so pretty. The guitar and piano that seems distant seems so pretty. I get the imagery of a field of wildgrasses and small white flowers at a lilac sunset. The lyrics themselves are quite sad, talking about how a family struggles, but the melancholy of it in itself is beautiful. 
                    Relaxation - Dreams by Fleetwood Mac - the song is not particularly complex, mostly a drum beat and bass riff with some guitar. The focal point is the lyrics, which are complimented well by Stevie Nicks’ soft voice. There are references to nature, which are often related to being chill and calm. The song is about accepting something happening to you. 
                    Sadness - She Lays Down by the 1975 - the song is purely guitar and vocals, giving it a raw feeling. It feels authentic and you can hear the pain in the singer’s voice as he sings about his mother’s postpartum depression. The lyrics are quite dark and depressing, but so genuine that it elicits an emotional response in me everytime. 
                    Dreaminess - Malibu 1992 by COIN - the song uses reverby and long sounds to emulate the feeling of a memory. The lyrics are about a specific memory the writer is reminiscing, and the percussion’s sound is almost muted, making it feel nostalgic. 
                    Triumph - Good Days by SZA - This song also feels nostalgic, and the guitar getting louder at the beginning feels like gaining confidence. SZA always sings with confidence, and the subject matter in the song talks about how she’s moving on well after something happened. 
                    Anxiety - 505 by Arctic Monkeys - The song is about missing an old lover and trying to relive a moment in time, but the singer can never quite do so. There's a lot of tension and build up until the bridge of the song. Slowly, the guitar riffs get faster and the song picks up tempo, making the listener anxious. The dynamics in the song differ greatly, starting off rather quiet and ending in a puddle of emotions. 
                    Scariness - thirteen by C418 - There are no lyrics to this song, and it sounds rather eerie. Rather than having a melody, the song is kind of a jumble of noises and creaks. It feels like you’re in a cave, and it feels like someone is following you because of the almost dissonance that the tones create. 
                    Annoyance - Spinning by No Rome, Charli XCX, the 1975 - this song is upbeat, but very repetitive and not for everyone. Personally, I like this song, but the lyrics aren’t very complex and it just sounds annoying. The singer is rather high pitched, and the lyrics aren’t very comprehensible. The chorus is quite repetitive, and there’s not much variation. 
                    Defiance - Teenagers by MCR - This song is about the standard teenage experience: angst. When you’re a teen, you generally don’t care about the opinions of the adults around you, and you’ll do anything to feel rebellious. The choice of instruments, electric guitars in particular, scream teenage angst. 
                    Pumped up - She Knows This by Kid Cudi - The song begins with a quote from Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, and turns into an enticing beat. The combination of Kid Cudi’s voice and the lyrics he’s speaking just pumps me up. He’s speaking about being at a party and feeling on top of the world. The tempo is the same for most of the song, it’s not too quick but enough to pump you up. But before some of the “choruses”, it speeds up quite a bit, which really emphasizes the vibes of the song.
